Ops Oracle (WIP)

1. Introduction
- Overview of the project
   - Goals and objectives
    * Goal of the project is to provide Rainbow Six Siege players with a tool to
      suggest better strategies to use in game based off the operators selected by the other team.
      Users would input the opponent's operator lineup along with the map+site they are playing on.
      The model would then use the available data provided to return a list of options to use for the round.
      This will help new players learn and understand the large complexity and learning curve of the game while helping advanced players
      raise the ceiling of their performance.
    * The data being used for to train and fine-tune the model is between December 2015 and December 2023.
      The reason for this is that R6 updates frequently and has big updates every 3 months called Seasons. Since a new season will be released March 12th 2024, it makes it easier to limit
      our model to the recent season.
    * Currently the project can be accessed via Flask which makes a web page with a GPT interface
      for the user to interact with. The future alternative will be a GUI created through PyQt5 that will be an overlay
      for when users are playing R6. The Flask page is will be easier to share as it can be hosted online for users to test the tool
      till the GUI interface has been completed, and can be shared using certain software to run the .exe file.
